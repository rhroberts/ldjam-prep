# ldjam-prep

A dummy game to learn what is involved in the process and not go into the game jam *completely* clueless.

## Info

**What**: [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/) - Jam Submission. [Rules here.](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules)

**When**: October 1st - 4th (Fri 3pm - Mon 3pm; 72hrs + 1hr submission window) 

**Where**: The Internet, as accessed from Cody & Karin's place. Bring your cat7s!

### Optional prep
  - Contribute to this repo
  - [Learn some Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html)
  - Read [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)
    
    this may seem like overkill, but this humble-looking (and pretty short) book is phenomenal and very approachable. It will get the juices flowing, I have no doubt. Each pattern is illustrated w/ an example that you will understand.

  - Watch some of Pixel Prophecies videos to get a feel for what it's like, what needs to be done, and how rough the time constraints are.

## Roles

While we can (and should) do whatever we are interested in, partitioning by role will _probably_ be helpful, although this is the kind of thing that would be better informed by experience. At the very least, the tasks we come up with can partition this way. Think about what big bucket you may want to focus on, maybe even throw your name down. No need for just one per, either.

LÖVE wins!

## Helpful Software

- Trello
  - I think it's likely we will want some solution for brainstorming, recording ideas, and recording / tracking tasks. I'm pretty partial to Trello, to be honest, and it can easily be made into a kanban mutant.
  - We could use Github "Projects" too - has kanban that integrates with Issues

- Aseprite
  - This is solid 2d pix software. Anything beyond pixels is probably beyond our grasp (个_个)

- Ardour
  - The venerable, cross-platform King of DAWs
  - https://ardour.org/

- Visual Studio Code
  - Collaborative editing feature could be nice
  - Can use a workspace config file to enforce autoformatting and such
    so all our code is reasonably consistent and readable
  - Makes working with git less of a pain for those not familiar with it
